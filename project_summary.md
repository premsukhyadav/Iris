# Project Summary Document

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a complete machine learning pipeline for [your specific task, e.g., iris classification, data processing, etc.].  
The objective is to provide a fully reproducible environment using Docker and version control with GitHub.

The project covers data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, all containerized to ensure portability.

## Deliverables Explained

1. **GitHub Repository**  
   The GitHub repository contains:  
   - All source code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and utilities.  
   - Raw and processed datasets.  
   - Saved trained model artifacts.  
   - Pipeline scripts to automate the workflow.

2. **Docker Hub Link**  
   Docker Hub is a public container registry. The Docker Hub link points to the pre-built image of this project, encapsulating the environment and code.  
   It allows easy distribution and execution on any machine with Docker.

3. **Summary Document**  
   This document describes the project in detail, explaining components, setup, and usage.

4. **5-minute Screen Recording**  
   A demo video showing repository cloning, Docker image build and run, and script executions.

## Project Components

**Codebase:**  
- `dataloader.py`: Loads raw data.  
- `preprocess.py`: Cleans and transforms data.  
- `train.py`: Trains and evaluates the model.  
- `utils.py`: Helper functions.

**Data:**  
- Raw data stored in `data/raw`.  
- Processed data stored in `data/processed`.  
- Pipeline automates data flow from raw to processed.

**Model:**  
- Trained model saved in `models/`.  
- Includes evaluation metrics.

**Pipeline:**  
- Automates end-to-end process.  
- Docker container ensures consistent environment.
